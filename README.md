## Szilvi Horvath

A former insurance claims advisor, accounts administrator and book-keeper, I am finally living my dream of learning to code and becoming a software engineer through the Makers Apprenticeship employed by Capgemini UK. 

## Skills

#### Communication

During my time as a car insurance claims advisor, I developed solid communications skills while dealing with customers - who had just crashed their cars - over the phone on a daily basis. This experience not only gave me the opportunity to learn how to better express myself even in high pressure situations, but also the importance of listening and reflecting on the clients problem to come up with the best solution.

#### Accuracy and organisational skills

As a former book-keeper and company administrator, attention to detail was a vital part of my role due to the nature of these roles.

During my work at SohoFrames, my first task was to transform the company's paper based ordering and invoicing system onto a much more effective computerised system. It was my responsibility to research and decide on a software that was easy to use, that was suitable for the business and that was easily accessible for the company's outsourced accountants too. After that I transferred all the relevant orders and invoices - a lot of data entry! - and liaised with the accountants to make sure they would receive all information they needed in order to prepare accounts at their end via the chosen software (Xero).
